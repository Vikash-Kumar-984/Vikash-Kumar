Hello Friends!</br>
I am a 3rd-year student and currently pursuing CSE at the [Faculty of Engineering and Technology-Jain University](https://set.jainuniversity.ac.in/), Bangalore, India.</br></br>
The main aim is to make end users have a great experience and effective usage of the resources. </br></br>
I am very excited and tries to keep updated with the current trends in the society. </br>
